Function/ID version 0.02
========================

DESCRIPTION

This module provides two variables, $this_fn and $this_function,
which report the name of the function currently running.  For
example:

    package Your::Module;
    use Function::ID;

    sub somefunc
    {
        print "Long form: $this_function\n";
        print "Short form: $this_fn\n";
    }

when invoked, somefunc will print the following:

    Long form: Your::Module::somefunc
    Short form: somefunc

This may be useful for log file messages, errors, debugging, etc.
